# Project "ratpenat"

> This project is under initial setup.

The "ratpenat" project is an iOS app to help dyslexic students keep up with their lessons. It will allow them to manage a library of audio snippets for their studies and automatically schedule their study sessions.

**"Ratpenat"** means bat in Catalan (see https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratpenats). The name was chosen by **my son Pau**.
