# Project "ratpenat"

> This project is under initial setup.

The "ratpenat" project is an iOS app to help dyslexic students keep up with their lessons. It will allow them to manage a library of audio snippets for their studies and automatically schedule their study sessions.

"Ratpenat" means bat in Catalan (see https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratpenats). The name was chosen by my son Pau.

All project development is traced using Github projects (see https://github.com/josealobato/ratpenat/projects?type=beta), and all decisions can be found on the included ADR (`doc/adr`).
