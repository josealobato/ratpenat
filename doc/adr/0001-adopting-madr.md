Technical Story: https://github.com/josealobato/ratpenat/issues/1

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to properly document all the desing decission during the project. That will help us to be consistent and keep a log for later reference helping on further decissions.

## Decision Drivers

* It has to be simple
* It has to be tool independent.

## Considered Options

Just one

* MADR as described in the followin source:
https://adr.github.io and https://adr.github.io/madr/

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "ADR", because it fulfils the requirements.

To create a new ADR we use the template that can be found at [ADR-0000](0000-template.md)

### Positive Consequences

* We have a simple tool to keep record of our decissions.

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* None
